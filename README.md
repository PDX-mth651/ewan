# mth651 - ewan

Ewan's c++ code repository for mth651 - advanced numerical analysis.  I have a CSR class that I built, but that is very rudimentary.  

I will use the (much better) library cloned from github.com/gelever to build an interative solver for matrix vector equations, a finite element solver for various partial differential equations, and possibly a multigrid solver as well.
